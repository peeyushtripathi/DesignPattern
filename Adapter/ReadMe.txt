This design pattern is mostly used when we want to make old APIs compatible with new APIs

suppose we have 2 classes which has run function 
and there is 1 class which has go function


now we want go function to also get called  

dynamic polymorphism ... base class pointer ... derived class object 


Wrote same program in basic cpp and advanced cpp
